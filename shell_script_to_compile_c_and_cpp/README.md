This Script will help to compile C and C++ Source File Without much typing commands and all

souce files are compile with -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -g 

-Wall option will turn on all warnings 

-Wextra option will turn on all warning unable to turning on by -Wall option

-pedantic option will turn on the strict iso  option

-Werror will treat all warnings by -Wall & -Wextra or -pedantic as error and terminate the compiling... 
thus it prevent any memory leak or any sorts of dumb error (not logical error) generated object file
and prevent your os not to crashing... 

-g option will add symbols for debuging to your object file... when you call object file with
 gnu debuger or gdb, gdb search for symbols that is generated by option -g and then it run the program

 i've writen this script to compile c and c++ source file with standered option also means -std="standard"
 
 -std="standard" option tell the gcc or g++ to compile with specific standard file... and i made this script
 to take input the stndard version from user... in shell script -std=$standerd 


*************************** That's All... this is a short description about my script**********************


HOW to run This script ?


clone this script from : https://github.com/souravdas142/shell-script.git

assuming that you've clone this script on your home directory

$ cd shell-script/shell_script_to_compile_c_and_cpp/

$ . gcc_Version_2.sh


or,


$ ./gcc_Version_2.sh  - for first case you don't need to give permission the shell script. but for seccond case case you've to give exicutable permission for user you're logged in. and and for both case immidiate after executing this it's first command will execute and immidiate you can compile... but if you don't want to compile immidiate you can terminate it with ^c. and later you don't need to execute the script again but you can call "gccv" command for next compile until you exit the terminal


or


$ sh gcc_Version_2.sh  - in this case bash shell is invoke a sub-shell and execute but after executing sub-shell will be destroyed and veriable can't be export to the parent shell, so this command can be use for one time execution and to compile again you've to reissuing this command...


so, the script want to take inputs from user which source you want to be compiled c or c++ next the file name without any extension next the object file name that is generated by the gcc or g++ next the standerd version of c or c++



Example : 


Enter Language ( gcc ( for C ) OR g++ ( for C++ ) ) : gcc


Enter Source file Name : insertionsort


Enter object file name : sort


Enter Standard ( Default -std=c11 ) :


insertionsort.c compiling with -std=c11


please wait... generating object sort...


object successfully generated...


if Script has any bug then please let me know about that i'll fix it... thanks...
