 only when you are know what are going to do

 This is a shell script file which will batch rename the extension of files under a directory

 when you are going to run the script you must be mention the target directory as first argument, destination directory as second argument and the extension name as the third argument
 for example : 

 sh rename_extension.sh target_directory destination_directory extension_name
 or, ./rename_extension.sh target_directory destination_directory extension_name

 files must be have same extension under target_directory


 don't run the script with out arguments mention earlier
 This is Sourav Das and i promise to make the script more efficient
