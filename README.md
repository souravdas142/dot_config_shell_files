Do only when you are know what are going to do

This is a shell script file which will batch rename the extension of files under a folder

when you are going to run the script you must be mention the target folder as first argument, destination folder as second argument and the extension name as the third argument

don't run the script with out arguments mention earlier
This is Sourav Das and i promise to make the script more efficient
